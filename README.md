# Final Project - Fake News Detector 

# Overview

**Business question**: in our turbulent time, how do you moderate the content on your site? Trolls are all aroundâ€¦ Protect yourself with our fake news detector!

**MVP**: model that classifies text as real or fake news (Binary Classification) using NLP methods with tensorflow - keras.

**Possible obstacles**: learning NLP methods. ambiguity and variety in text .

**Nice To Have**: 

- Data pipeline that takes current news and prepares them for classification.
- A model that is actually good.
- sentiment analysis and comparison.
